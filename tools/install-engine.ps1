.SYNOPSIS
  Builds either the legacy patched engine or a clean pinned upstream baseline.

.DESCRIPTION
  One command, from nothing to a patched codex.exe. The script:

    1. checks that the tools that cannot be installed for you are present (git, cargo);
    2. clones openai/codex at the exact commit the patch was generated against, so the patch applies
       cleanly instead of failing against a moved upstream;
    3. applies patch\model-provider-routes.patch;
    4. builds codex-rs with `cargo build -p codex-cli --bin codex`;
    5. prints the path of the engine binary and the next steps.

  Use -EnginePath to patch an existing checkout instead of cloning. The checkout must be at the
  pinned commit and have no modified files.

  With -BaselineOnly, the script pins the latest validated stable release without a patch.
  With -RoutingPatch, it applies the model-routing-only patch to that stable release. Neither
  mode changes the legacy default installer path or the Microsoft Store desktop engine.

  What it cannot do for you: Node.js and the compatibility proxy, the provider API key, and the
  client launch configuration. Those live in the README; this script stops once the engine builds.

.PARAMETER EnginePath
  Existing upstream checkout to patch. Omit to clone a fresh one under -WorkDir.

.PARAMETER WorkDir
  Where to clone the engine when -EnginePath is not given. Defaults to .\codex-engine.

.PARAMETER Profile
  Cargo profile to build. Defaults to release because that is what the client should run.

.PARAMETER BaselineOnly
  Build the pinned stable upstream engine without applying this repository's older patch. This is
  for validating the new baseline while the provider-routing patch is being ported separately.

.PARAMETER RoutingPatch
  Build the stable 0.158.0 engine with only the model-provider routing patch from issue #8.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-engine.ps1
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-engine.ps1 -EnginePath C:\src\codex
